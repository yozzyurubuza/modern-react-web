Creating a Reusable, Configurable Component

1. Identify the JSX that appears to be duplicated

2. What is the purpose of that block of JSX? Thinks of a descriptive name for what it does.

3. Create a new file to house this new component - it should have the same name as the component.

4. Create a new component in the new file, paste the JSX into it.

5. Make the new component configurable by using React's 'props' system.
