Accessing DOM with Refs

Flow:

1. Let the ImageCard render itself and its image.

2. Reach into the DOM and figure out the height of the image.

3. Set the image height on state to get the component to renderer.

4. When rerendering, assign a 'grid-row-end' to make sure the image takes up the appropriate space.


React Refs:

* Gives access to a single DOM element

* We create refs in the constructor, assign them to instance variables, then pass to a particular JSX element as props.
