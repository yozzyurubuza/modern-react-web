Timeline:

1. JS file loaded by browser
2. Instance of App component is created
3. App components 'constructor' function gets called
4. State object is created and assigned to the 'this.state' property
5. We call geolocation service
6. React calls the components render method
7. App returns JSX, gets rendered to page as HTML
...
8. We get result of geolocation
9. We update our state object with a call to 'this.setState'
10. React sees that we updated the state of a component
11. React calls our 'render' method a second time
12. Render method returns some (updated) JSX
13. React takes that JSX and updates content on the screen





Rules of Class Components

1. Must be a Javascript Class
2. Must extend (subclass) React.Component
3. Must define a 'render' method that returns some amount of JSX
