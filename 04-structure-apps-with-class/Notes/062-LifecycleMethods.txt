Introducing Lifecycle Methods

Component Lifecycle

Timeline:

1. Constructor - optional
    - Good place to do one-time setup

2. Render - not optional, need to define
    - Avoid doing anything besides returning JSX
    - Content Visible on screen
    
3. componentDidMount 
    - Can put code inside to set up or do some initial data loading.
    - Good place to do data-loading!
    - It has similar function with Constructor but data loading is recommended to be placed here for cleaner code.

* Sit and wait for updates... (setState)

4. componentDidUpdate
    - Good place to do more data-loading when state/props change

* Sit and wait until this component is not longer shown

5. componentWillUnmount - stop showing component / cleanup
    - Good place to do cleanup (especially for non-React stuff)


Other lifecycle methods (rarely used)

* shouldComponentUpdate
* getDerivedStateFromProps
* getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
