Rules of State

1. Only usable with class components
    - Technically can be used with functional components using the 'hooks' system (thing to discuss later)

2. You will confuse props with State

3. 'State' is a JS object that contains data relevant to a component

4. Updating 'state' on a component causes the component to (almost) instantly rerender

5. State must be initialized when a component is created.

6. State can only be updated using the function 'setState'
