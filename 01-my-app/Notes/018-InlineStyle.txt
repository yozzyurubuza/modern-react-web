JSX vs HTML

* Adding custom styling to an element uses different syntax
Ex.
HTML - <div style="background-color: red;"></div>
JSX - <div style={{backgroundColor: 'red'}}></div>

- Outer curly brace means we want to reference a JavaScript Variable
- 2nd curly brace is a JavaScript object


* Adding a class to an element uses different syntax

JSX = className / JS = class

- The reason for this is because we don't want JavaScript to get confused and think that we are trying to define a new JavaScript class in the JSX line.


* JSX can reference JS variables
