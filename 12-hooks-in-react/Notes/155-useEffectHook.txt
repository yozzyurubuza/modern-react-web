The 'useEffect' Hook

* Allows function components to use something like lifecycle methods

* We configure the hook to run some code automatically in one of three scenarios
    1. When the component is rendered for the first time only
    2. When the component is rendered for the first time and whenever it rerenders
    3. When the component is rendered for the first time and (whenever it rerenders and some piece of data has changed)


UseEffect Second Argument

[] - Run at initial render

..nothing.. - Run at initial render > Run after every rerender

[data] - Run at initial > Run after every rerender if data has changed since last rerender.
