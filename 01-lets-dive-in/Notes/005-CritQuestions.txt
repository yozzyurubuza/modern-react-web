1. What was that 'App' function?
* The App function is a React component
* App Component - Produces JSX and handles user events
       -> Returns...
      JSX - Set of instructions to tell React what content 

JSX Elements
* Tell React to create a normal HTML element (div, span, h1, table, hr, input)
* Tell React to show another component (Field, Translate, Languages)

Sample Return JSX Scenario:
* Is this a DOM Element? -> Yes -> OK, show a div on the screen to the user.
* Is this a DOM Element? -> No, it is a component -> OK, call the component function and inspect all the JSX we get back.


2. How did some content get displayed on the screen?

ReactDOM.render(
    <App /> // Call the App function, get back JSX, and turn it into HTML
    document.getElementById("root") // Then take that HTML and put it into the DOM inside this div (./public/index.html)
)


3. What's the difference between React and ReactDOM?
* React - Knows how to work with components
        - Called a 'reconciler'

* ReactDOM - Knows how to take instructions on what we want to
             show and turn it into HTML.
           - Called a 'renderer'
          

4. What was all the 'useState' stuff?
* useState - Function for working with React's 'state' system
           - State is used to keep track of data that changes over time
           - Used to make React update the HTML on the screen
